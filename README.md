DisguiseCraft
=============

Plugin for MCServer that allows you to disguise as a mob. 
It's not like bukkit's one, because of MCServer limitations. You see the mob and it doesn't always follows you, but ill try to make the best inside MCS limitations.

Commands:
---
/d [mobtype]         Disguise as the specified mob

/ud         Undisguise
